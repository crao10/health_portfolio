                        Healthcare AI startups are racing to build foundation models that could revolutionize drug discovery, medical imaging, and clinical care. But they're hitting a wall.
                        
                        Training a protein folding model requires thousands of GPU hours. Analyzing genomic datasets at scale needs massive parallel compute. And healthcare AI can't afford to fail: models must be accurate, explainable, and clinically validated.
                        Most startups can't afford the compute infrastructure they need but also don't know where they should start. Cloud credits run out etc. They're forced to choose between model performance and runway.

                            <strong>The Challenge:</strong> A-Alpha Bio, a spinout from Nobel Prize winner David Baker's lab at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design, developed AlphaSeq—a revolutionary platform for measuring protein-protein interactions at unprecedented scale. The technology uses genetically engineered yeast cells and next-generation sequencing to characterize millions of protein binding interactions simultaneously, solving a critical bottleneck in antibody and drug discovery.
The startup had groundbreaking science but faced the classic commercialization challenge: translating a sophisticated yeast display platform into partnerships with pharmaceutical companies who needed to understand why this approach was superior to existing methods.

                       Healthcare founders evaluate Google Cloud, AWS, and AMD based on compute cost. But they struggle to articulate why NVIDIA's complete stack matters: CUDA as the standard, plus specific frameworks like MONAI (imaging), BioNeMo (drug discovery), and Parabricks (genomics). I can help founders understand that they're not just getting compute, they're getting a domain-ready infrastructure and a global ecosystem that accelerates clinical validation, partnership conversations, and investor confidence.

                    I'm excited to build this systematically at NVIDIA: helping healthcare startups access the compute infrastructure, technical frameworks, and enterprise partnerships they need to move from breakthrough science to clinical impact.
